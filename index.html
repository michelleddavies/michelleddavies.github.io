                                        I am an alumna of Cornell University's College of Engineering. In May of 2022, I graduated from Cornell with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering. From a young age, I have had a passion for creation and innovation. Whether it be building 3D models, graphic designs, websites or robotics projects, I'm always ready to take on a new challenge. My goal in life is to develop assistive technology for children with special needs.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to explore my passions further, and continue to develop projects that address different needs that I see in the world, across different mediums. From Data Visualization to Machine Learning and constructing new data pipelines, I love to adapt to new platforms - and I'm a fast learner too! If you're willing to have me, I'm ready to help further and elevate any project!
                                    </p>

                                        I design technological, practical solutions to the challenges I encounter. I came into this field of STEM with passion, skill and a propensity to learn and acquire new resources, but I was not always confident in that knowledge. Through being challenged in the spaces that I have been blessed to be part of and having the opportunity to think bigger and create the change that I wanted to see, I learned to be the first person to believe in myself.

                                        <p> One of the many aspects of the Technology industry that motiates me is the opportunity to to pursue my interests in depth. I like to explore technology in the form of use cases, where I can combine tools to create a model which allows people to better understand how technology can augment the world we live in. I learn something new, I get to hone my problem-solving skills, and most importantly, I get to challenge myself in new ways. </p>

                                            The challenge of building a working platform that helps to address a problem AND is user-friendly is one that I choose to tackle head-on with every project. The software lifecycle can be very iterative and requires a lot of collaboration. I typically take a Test-Driven Development approach on individual work when possible. However, I also adapt to a team's chosen workflow in my contributions in order to deliver in the end.

This project was done entirely in Python, from the photo-editing to the GUI that it is hosted in.</td>

This will enable the user to do simple tasks like hold a cup or open a door. We noticed that many of the hands that were created did not have a way to save and replay their motions. So in the future we plan on making this function. Also buying a functional prosthetic arm is really expensive so with our project we are hoping that we will be able to make buying prosthetics more cost effective.</td>

There were many design considerations I made for this, like having dots and dashes appear on two different sets is lights to made them clear and distinguishable, thus improving readability. Overall, this project has been successful. When I have a greater budget and the necessary materials, I see myself upgrading this project by attempting to make a remote connection to the Arduino so that it does not have to be connected to work, and by mobilizing it so that it can "auto-deliver" any message to my family in these times of social distancing, Granted, I may need a sound component in case something happens to the circuit of lights or the message can't be interpreted for another reason.</td>

In this project, I display colors both in RGB LEDs and in terns of it's constituent R, G, and B values. This project has opened up opportunities for me to explore and analyze the random function, and system/computer colors as a whole. Check out the gallery and documentation to find out more about my final result! [UPDATE: I added a connection between this project and the My Image Suite Python script (see Projects > My Image Suite) by adding functionality so that I can display the RGB values of a selected photo's pixels through the board. The method for parsing the image is similar to this, with the added step of importing a photo in Arduino and the syntax for parsing the list of pixels].</td>

The way it works is that there are five rounds where, once each round starts, the first player to hit the button gets a point. The player that reaches 5 points first wins! But beware, if one player cheats by trying to press the button early, the other player gets the point for that round. Check out my gallery to see it in action!</td>

There are many solutions being developed to make it easier for able-bodied individuals to communicate with deaf individuals. However, few solutions exist to ease the barrier of communication for deaf people. So, I decided to develop a Voice to ASL and Morse Code robotic hand to decode verbal speech to visual signals and representations to bridge this communicative gap on the other end.</td>
